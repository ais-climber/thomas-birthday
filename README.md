# thomas-birthday
Just a little tkinter game my sister Amanda and I made for our cousin Thomas’ 11th birthday (the art is Amanda’s). I (Caleb Kisby) wrote the Python code, and my sister Amanda Kisby drew all of the art.  Thomas had just gotten his YMCA green band, so the game stars Thomas swimming in deep water wearing his band. Grab presents, but be careful not to pop balloons!

To run, just have `python3` and `python3-tk` (tkinter) installed, and call `python3 main.py`.  I planned on this to be run on my Aunt's Windows machine, so the acceleration is a bit silly on Linux.  I hope you enjoy, regardless!
