# thomas-birthday
Just a little tkinter game for my little cousin Thomas' birthday in June of 2015.  I (Caleb Kisby) wrote the Python code, and my sister Amanda Kisby drew all of the art.

To run, just have `python3.x` installed, and call `python3 main.py`.  I planned on this to be run on my Aunt's Windows machine, so the acceleration is a bit silly on Linux.  I hope you enjoy, regardless!
